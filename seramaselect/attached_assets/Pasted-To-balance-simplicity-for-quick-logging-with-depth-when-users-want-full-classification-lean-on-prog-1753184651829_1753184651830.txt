To balance simplicity for quick logging with depth when users want full classification, lean on progressive disclosure and a tiered workflow:

1. Two Modes (Basic vs. Detailed)
Basic Mode

Fields shown: Bird name/ID, Sex, Recorded weight, and (optionally) Conformation Type (CT).

Save: Captures only those core fields.

When to use: Day-to-day logging, flock census, quick notes.

Detailed Mode

Fields shown: Everything in Basic, plus Extended Traits (ET), Plumage Type (PT), Color Variety (CV), and auto-calculated warnings/score.

Access:

A toggle/button (“Add full classification”) on the Basic form

Or a second tab/step in a wizard (“Advanced details”)

2. Form Structure & UX Patterns
Step-by-Step Wizard

Step 1: Core Info (always required)

Step 2: Classification (optional—only if user clicks “Advanced”)

Step 3: Review & Save (show summary of CT, PT, CV, warnings)

Collapsible Panels (Accordions)

Keep ET, PT, CV sections collapsed by default under a header like “Advanced classification.”

When expanded, they load their inputs (lazy-loaded code) so you don’t slow down the initial form render.

Inline Defaults & Smart Presets

CT: default to the bird’s last known CT or the most common one for that sex.

PT/CV: default to “Smooth” and “Other” (or whatever your most frequent values are).

Weight: prefill with the bird’s last recorded weight (if editing) or leave blank for new entries.

Tooltips & Help Text

Keep labels short (“Extended Traits”) but add a “?” icon that explains what ET are and why you’d record them.

Offer sample values or an “Auto-classify” button that runs your classifyBird logic immediately to give them feedback.

3. Data Model & Storage
Separate Tables/Collections

Birds (minimal): { id, name, sex, lastWeight, lastCT }

Classifications: { birdId, timestamp, CT, PT, CV, ET: {...}, weight, warnings }

Link Records

Every time you “save” you create a new Classification doc—but the Bird entry stays lean.

On the Bird profile page, show a chronological list of classifications; default view only shows CT & weight, with a “View details” expand for full ET/PT/CV.

4. Performance & Code Organization
Lazy-load your ET/PT/CV form components

js
Copy
Edit
const AdvancedForm = React.lazy(() => import('./AdvancedForm'));
This way the main, basic form bundle stays small.

Config-driven fields

Drive your form inputs from the same JSON maps you use for classification (CT_MAP, PT_MAP, CV_MAP).

That reduces duplication and keeps form and logic in sync.

Form Library + Validation

Use something like React Hook Form or Formik to manage conditional fields, validation, and performance on large forms.

5. Keeping It Systematic
Consistent Entry Point

Always “Add new Bird” → Basic form → optional Advanced

Single Save Action

Don’t scatter multiple save buttons—have one “Save” at the bottom of whatever mode you’re in.

Editable Later

Even if someone saves only Basic, they can always “Edit details” to fill in ET/PT/CV later.

Clear Labels

In your UI, differentiate “Record basic info” vs. “Record full classification.”

Feedback Loop

After save, show a toast/alert:

“Basic record saved”

or “Full classification saved—CT: TA, PT: Frizzled, CV: Black”

In a nutshell
Default to minimal fields.

Offer an “Advanced” path for full ET/PT/CV capture.

Lazy-load and config-drive the heavy form bits.

Store core bird info separately from detailed classification snapshots.

Always let users upgrade a basic record to detailed with a single click.

That approach keeps your app fast and simple for everyday logging, yet fully comprehensive whenever a user—or a judge—needs the nitty-gritty detail.
