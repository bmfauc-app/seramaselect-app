Right now you’re writing every bird into the same top-level records collection in Firestore, using whatever traitData.id is (or record_${Date.now()} when creating new) as the document’s ID:

js
Copy
Edit
// in TraitContext.jsx, saving a record  
const record = {  
  id: traitData.id || `record_${Date.now()}`, …  
};  
await setDoc(doc(db, 'records', record.id), record);  
TraitContext

That means any two users who end up using the same ID will overwrite one another’s data. Even though Date.now() is unlikely to collide across devices, if you ever load an existing record (e.g. by clicking “Edit”) you’ll get the same id in your context—and another user loading that record and saving it will stomp your bird’s entry.

Strategies to avoid collisions
Use per-user namespacing
Move each user’s birds into a subcollection under their UID, for example:

js
Copy
Edit
// instead of collection(db,'records'),
// use collection(db, 'users', currentUser.uid, 'records')
await setDoc(
  doc(db, 'users', currentUser.uid, 'records', record.id),
  record
);
Now even if two users both have a bird with id = "bird123", they live in different paths (…/users/alice/records/bird123 vs. …/users/bob/records/bird123) and never clash.

Let Firestore auto-generate IDs
If you don’t need to control the document ID yourself, replace

js
Copy
Edit
doc(db, 'records', record.id)
with

js
Copy
Edit
const colRef = collection(db, 'users', currentUser.uid, 'records');
const newDoc = await addDoc(colRef, record);
record.id = newDoc.id;  // Firestore’s guaranteed-unique ID
Firestore’s addDoc will give you a collision-proof ID, and you can store it back on your record if you need to reference it later.

Embed the user’s UID in your custom ID
If you prefer consistent, human-readable IDs but still want to avoid collisions, include the UID (or a short hash) as part of the ID:

js
Copy
Edit
const recordId = `${currentUser.uid}_${Date.now()}`;  
await setDoc(doc(db, 'records', recordId), { … });
Security and multi-user isolation
Whichever approach you pick, you’ll also want to update your Firestore Security Rules so that each user can only read/write their own documents. For example, under the users/{uid}/records/{rid} path you’d enforce:

js
Copy
Edit
allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;
That way even if someone guesses another user’s record ID, they simply won’t have permission to touch it.

By namespacing per user or relying on Firestore’s built-in ID guarantees, you completely eliminate any risk of two users stepping on each other’s birds.
