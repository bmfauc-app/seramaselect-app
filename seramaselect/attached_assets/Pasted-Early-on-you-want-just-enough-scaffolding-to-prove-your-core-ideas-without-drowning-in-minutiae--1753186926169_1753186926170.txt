Early on, you want just enough “scaffolding” to prove your core ideas, without drowning in minutiae. Think of it as building your house:

Lay a strong foundation (MVP scope & core flows)

Identify your top 2–3 user journeys. For Serama Select, that might be:

“I want to enter a new bird and get an instant classification.”

“I want to browse saved records and edit one.”

“I want to upload bird photos and see them in my record.”

Sketch the simplest screens that cover those flows—just wireframes or boxes on paper.

Define the minimum data model: what’s the bare-bones record you need? (e.g. bird ID, sex, CT, PT, CV, image URL).

Build the “skeleton” before stuffing it with content

Wire up real navigation and empty placeholders where your big data tables will go.

Hook up form fields for the essential traits and save/load from Firebase (even if they’re initially unlabeled).

Get classification logic running against a tiny test set instead of the full chart.

Validate & iterate before enriching

Show this lightweight prototype to a fellow breeder (or yourself!), and walk through:

“Can I create a record?”

“Do I understand where to click next?”

“Does the summary make sense at a glance?”

Tweak the flows, labels, and data model until those core journeys feel frictionless.

Progressively disclose complexity

Once your MVP is solid, start adding real trait-selection detail in phases:

Phase 1: Populate the TraitSelector with the four most critical traits.

Phase 2: Add the next eight traits (grouped logically).

Phase 3: Bring in the full palette of color varieties and extended traits.

Use accordion panels or “Advanced options” toggles so casual users aren’t overwhelmed.

Keep accessibility & documentation in mind

Even in your early builds, label form controls clearly and ensure keyboard navigation works.

Maintain a living spec (markdown or a simple Confluence page) that records:

What each screen must do

Which data fields exist and why

Any known gaps or “coming soon” items

Rule of thumb
“If you can’t build it in 3 days, you’re over-designing it.”
Start by fully shipping a tiny, polished slice of functionality. Once that’s in users’ hands—real or imaginary—you’ll know exactly which details to flesh out next, and you’ll avoid investing in features people might never use.
